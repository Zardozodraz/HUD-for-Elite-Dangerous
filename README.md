![ScreenshotDemo3HUD](Images/ScreenshotDemo3HUD.png)

## üßæ Description

This project is a custom Heads-Up Display (HUD) for Elite Dangerous that provides real-time information for exploration and exobiology, session statistics (coming soon), and tactical decision support (planned). It reads the game‚Äôs journal logs to extract key data such as your current system, credits earned, kills, targets scanned, and more. The HUD is designed to be fast and lightweight, with a clean interface built using Python‚Äôs tkinter, and leverages modules like pygame and requests for enhanced functionality.
